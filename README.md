# Bugg
A website where one can handle all the required things for hosting a dance tournament.
- Add and track participants
- Define rounds
- Group generation
- Judges can judge

The first step is to reach feature comparity to http://github.com/simonkinds/4temps-tournament, but through an improved abstraction model hopefully it can be extended to other dances.
